    <p>
      I love to organize products, branding, amd features. I love to work with
      all kinds of people, and mediating people who don't get along.
    </p><p>
      I’m also a full-stack developer with 16+ years of professional experience.
      I’m very passionate about writing and learning code, starting with old
      PHP. My main interests has recently been in Vue, static sites, and modern
      PHP/CSS like the Laravel system, but I’m always happy to learn something
      new.
    </p><p>
      What I really love is working behind the scenes. I’ve worked extensively
      with Github, adapating legacy code to modern standards, and finding the
      right tools for any job. I love helping with connections between different
      company departments to make sure all needs are met and everyone is working
      happily and efficiently. I've worked with other commpanies, government
      boards, and dissatisfied customers.
    </p><p>
      I’m looking a good job in Geneva, Lausanne, or a remote job in a similar
      time zone right now. If you’d like me on your team,
