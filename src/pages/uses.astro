    Download Resume I love to organize products, branding, amd features. I love
    to work with all kinds of people, and mediating people who don't get along.
    I’m also a full-stack developer with 16+ years of professional experience.
    I’m very passionate about writing and learning code; my main interest has
    been in Laravel, Go, Vue, static sites, and modern PHP/CSs, but I’m always
    happy to learn something new. What I really love is working behind the
    scenes. I’ve worked extensively with Github, adapating legacy code to modern
    standards, and finding the right tools for any job. I love helping with
    connections between different company departments to make sure all needs are
    met and everyone is working happily and efficiently. I've worked with other
    commpanies, government boards, and dissatisfied customers. I’m looking a
    good job in Geneva, Lausanne, or a remote job in a similar time zone right
    now; if you’d like me on your team,
