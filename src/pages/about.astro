        I worked for many year as Fullstack Developer with a strength in PHP and
        other backend tools. Since then I've been realizing that a lot of my
        work and strengths focused on other people and resolving the issues of
        departments that didn't undertand each other.

        <img src="/jungfrau-face.jpg" style="max-width: 250px;" />
        <p>Vacation in Jungfrau...</p>
      </div><p>
        These days I've been more focused on teaching, consulting, and helping
        businesses grow.

        Off the computer, I live in Paris (though I'm from the US) with my wife
        and two cats. I love to write songs and play music with friends, and I
        love to travel and meet different kinds of people.
        <p></p>
        If you're interested in working with me, I'd love to hear from you! You can
