        Like most web nerds, I regularly redesign my personal site based on the
        technology I want to learn more about, or because I have two much time
        on my hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time, it was slightly different, as I am moving my orginizational
        skills into the fore-front. I've been programming for so many years, and
        providing these services for free, that I would like to officially lead
        projects and operations, something I'm very good at.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, this site is designed with a slighly more friendly, less
        minimalist feel. I've spent much of my life in the desert, so my palette
        was chosen based on that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many friend's opinions and help went into writing and editing this time
        - I've listed all the credits on the side.
